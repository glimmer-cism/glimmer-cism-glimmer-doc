\label{ug.sec.varlist}
The following list shows all the variable names used by GLIMMER. Only variables marked with $^\ast$ are loaded by the input routines.
\section{Glide Variables}
\input{\dir/glide_varlist.tex}
\section{EIS Variables}
\input{\dir/eis_varlist.tex}
\section{GLINT Variables}
\subsection{Variables for \texttt{[CF output]}}
The following variables are available for output at each GLIDE
timestep, and represent the fields as they relate to the icesheet
timestep. They should be included in a \texttt{[CF output]} section.
\input{\dir/glint_varlist.tex}
\subsection{Variables for \texttt{[GLINT output]}}
The following variables are available for output each time GLINT is
called, including at intervals shorter than the icesheet timestep. The
represent instantaneous fields in the coupling scheme, and should be
included in a \texttt{[GLINT output]} section.
