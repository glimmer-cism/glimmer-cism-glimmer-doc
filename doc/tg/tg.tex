There are many tools for visualising netCDF files. In particular \href{http://meteora.ucsd.edu/~pierce/ncview\_home\_page.html}{\texttt{ncview}} and \href{http://www.epic.noaa.gov/java/ncBrowse/}{\texttt{ncBrowse}} are usefule viewers. We also provide a number of Python programs and classes using \href{http://gmt.soest.hawaii.edu/}{GMT} which produce postscript images of the GLIMMER netCDF files.

This chapter provides a brief manual and a cookbook of how to use the PyCF tools.
