\subsection{Using \texttt{plotCFdiff.py}}
\begin{pycf}{plotCFdiff.py fenscan.nc fenscan-gthf.nc diff.ps}{\dir/figures/diff.eps}
plots a graphical diff of two GLIMMER model runs. You can change the time interval using the \texttt{-t} or \texttt{-T} option. The three top panels show the difference of the ice volume, ice area and melt fractional area. The lower panels show 2D histograms of the difference to give you an idea of the distribution of differences.
