\section{Introduction}
This tutorial section aims to provide a set of more practical, step-by-step
instructions of how to first get GLIMMER started after the successful
installation and familiarising yourself with the different climate driver
options. In general, this tutorial is intended to address the question:

\emph{'I have successfully compiled GLIMMER, now what? Do I have to write my
own config files, climate drivers etc? I want to see some ice sheet modelling
pronto!'}\\

The really short version of an answer to this is type
\begin{verbatim}
glide_launch.py myconfig.config
\end{verbatim}
where \texttt{myconfig.config} is a configuration file for GLIMMER as described
in the documentation. If you have a config file and all the necessary data
ready, this is how you get GLIMMER started. \\
Assuming that if you're reading this, you might not yet have your own config
file ready, you might want to read on:
