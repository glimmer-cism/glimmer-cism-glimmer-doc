\subsection{GLINT: using glint-example}
If finally you want to see what GLIMMER can do using the GLINT climate driver,
download the \texttt{glint-example} and try one of the provided example setups.
CD into the directory and try any of the config examples, e.g.
\begin{verbatim}
    glide_launch.py -m glint_example gland20.config
\end{verbatim}

Notice the model type (binary) to use can be stated in the configuration file,
or given using the \texttt{-m} option. Currently, the three model binaries that
come with GLIMMER are \texttt{simple\_glide, eis\_glide} and
\texttt{glint\_example}.
